Basic things to remember about ML with Tensorflow.

Terms:
Labels - Things we are predicting(Spam or not spam)
Features - Input variables used to predict labels.
Train - Using labelled examples to form the model to then predict unlabelled examples.
Model - Defines the relationship between feature and label.
Loss - number predicting how bad the modle's prediction was on a single example.
Training - Determine good values for weights and bias that minimizes loss.

Types of Models:
Regression - A model that predicts continuous values.
Classification - A model that predicts discrete values.
-- 
Simple ML formula:
y = wx + b
y = label
w = weights
x = feature
b = bias
