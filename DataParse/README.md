A file used to parse a weird report formatted text file of user data

Useful stuff I should use for future regex in python:

Pythex - Really useful python regex parser with a nice dynamic result set, helpful for checking regex matches quickly
https://pythex.org/

Regex 101 - Nice for getting initial regular expression going, very good typesetting

KnottyUnfitApplication - Online python interpreter with command prompt, useful for testing python regex functions if you think your python installation is broken(when really you're writing it wrong)
